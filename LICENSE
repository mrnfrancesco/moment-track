of this license is perpetual, commencing upon acceptance of this Agreement by

written consent from the Owner which will not be unreasonably withheld nor
delayed.

2. USE. the Owner shall be responsible for the delivery of the
Licensed Program(s) together with the documentation. The Customer shall be
exclusively responsible for the supervision, management and control of its use
of the Licensed Program(s), including without limitation; (i) assuring proper

The Licensed Program and Licensed Materials may be used only in the furtherance
of the internal operations of the Customer to ensure the Owner's test in Sistemi

In no event shall the Licensed Program be used to process information by or for
the benefit of third parties.

The Customer may, from time to time, change the Designated Site and/or the

the Customer is authorized to use the Licensed Program on only one (1) of the
Customer's computers.

The Customer may not copy or otherwise reproduce the Licensed Program, or any
part thereof.
The Customer may reproduce the Licensed Materials solely for its own internal
use provided that all titles, trademarks, trade names, copyright notices, and
other proprietary notices of the Owner are retained.

3. CONFIDENTIALITY. The ideas and the expressions hereof contained in the
Licensed Program and Licensed Materials are confidential, proprietary
information and trade secrets that the Customer will receive in confidence. The
Customer shall not in any manner or form disclose, provide or otherwise make
available, in whole or in part, any Licensed Program and/or Licensed Materials
to any third parties.
The obligations expressed within this Section 3 shall survive termination of
this Agreement.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that all Parties' information, even if not
marked as "Confidential", that comes to be known by reason of work under this
Agreement, is confidential to each Party and will not be disclosed to
unauthorized third parties.
Information received by either Party under this Agreement will not be considered
confidential if the information: (a) is marked "Non Confidential"; (b) is known
to the other Party or is in the other Party's possession at the time of
executing this Agreement; (c) is in the public domain at the time of disclosure;
(d) is independently developed by the other Party; or (e) is disclosed to the
other Party by a third party with written approval of the first Party.

4. WARRANTIES. the Owner warrants that (i) it may lawfully grant the License,
(ii) neither the Licensed Program or Licensed Materials, or the use
thereof within the scope of the License, infringes a patent or copyright or is
claimed to be a trade secret of any person who has not consented to the granting
of the License, (iii) at the time of installation the Licensed Program, will
conform to applicable printed documentation (i.e., all Licensed Materials,
including User Guides and Reference Manuals) delivered by the Owner to the
Customer; (iv) neither the Licensed Program nor the Licensed Materials contain
any virus, time bomb mechanism or other software or code that can disable or
adversely affect any and all of the Licensed Program or the Licensed Materials
or destroy any data or other software; and (v) both the Licensed Program and the
Licensed Materials are Year 2000 Compliant. THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. None except the Owner is authorized to give a greater or different
warranty.

5. INDEMNIFICATION. the Owner, at its own expense, will defend and indemnify
against any action brought against the Customer based on a claim that any
Licensed Program infringed a United States patent, copyright or trademark
provided that (i) the Owner shall be notified promptly in writing by the
Customer of any notice of such claim; (ii) the Owner shall have the sole control
of the defense of any action on such claim and all negotiations for its
settlement or compromise; and (iii) the Customer shall permit the Owner, at
its own expense, either to procure for the Customer the right to continue using
the Licensed Program or modify the Licensed Program so that it becomes
non-infringing.

6. LIABILITY. Except as provided for in Section 5 above, the Owner's
liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, and
regardless of the form of action, in no event will the Owner be liable for any
lost profits, goodwill, or other consequential, special or indirect damages
suffered by the Customer in connection with or arising from the performance of
the Licensed Program, even if the Owner has been advised of the possibility of
such damages; or for any claim against the Customer by any other party.

7. MAINTENANCE PLAN. The Customer will not receive any maintenance or support
from the Owner.

9. GENERAL. The Customer acknowledges that he has read this Agreement,
understands it and agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions hereof. All
subsequent modifications, amendments, and waivers to this Agreement must be by
written instrument, executed by authorized representatives of the parties
hereto. In the event that any provision under this Agreement shall be deemed
illegal or otherwise unenforceable by any applicable statute or rule of law,
such provision shall be omitted and the entire Agreement shall not fail on
account thereof and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a waiver of any other breach of any other provision hereof. The Owner
shall not be liable for delay or failure to perform its obligations herein set
forth if such delay or failure is due to any cause or condition beyond its
reasonable control. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of any successor of the Customer, who, whether by merger, purchase, or otherwise,
acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Customer.

Both parties agree that neither party shall solicit or hire the other party's
employees involved directly in the relationship established by this Agreement as
an employee or as a consultant in the same geographical region. This provision
shall remain in effect with no expiration date.
Both parties recognize that their employees are valuable resources whose loss
may be damaging to their respective businesses, and therefore, violation of this
restriction shall result in the violating party making an immediate restitution
payment of $250,000 to the other, payable within 30 days of the start date of the
hired employee or consultant.

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be by written instrument
and shall be deemed given upon certified mailing with return receipt, addressed
to the party to be notified at the address set forth on Page 2 of this Agreement,
or, if to the Owner, addressed to 90, Bellinzona street, Modena (MO), Italy.


This Agreement represents the complete and exclusive statement of the agreements
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations
between them. In the event of conflict between general Terms and Conditions and
Schedule 1 the following order of precedence shall apply: Schedule 1, Terms and
Conditions. This Agreement is binding upon the parties upon execution by
Customer and acceptance by the Owner.

This Agreement has to be considered accepted at the time the Licensed Program
and Licensed Materials were received by the Customer.
